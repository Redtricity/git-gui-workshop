# 👩‍💻 Git + GitHub (GUI — Graphical User Interface)

Welcome to the **Git + GitHub Lab!**  
Today you’ll learn how developers really use **Git and GitHub** — through **visual tools** like **GitHub.com** and **GitHub Desktop**.  
You’ll create branches, make commits, push changes, open pull requests, and handle merge conflicts — all without touching the command line.  

---

## 🌱 Part 1 — Personal Branch

1. **Open the repository** in **GitHub Desktop** (or click “Code → Open with GitHub Desktop”).  
2. Create a **new branch** with your name (example: `branch-lara`).  
3. In your local files, open the `people/` folder and create a **new file** named after you (example: `lara.md`).  
4. Write a short message inside, such as:  
   > Hi, I'm Lara!  
5. Go back to GitHub Desktop and **commit your changes** (add a short commit message).  
6. Click **Push origin** to upload your branch to GitHub.  
7. On **GitHub.com**, open a **Pull Request** to merge your branch into **main**.  
8. Once approved, **merge** your PR and **delete your branch**.

## 💬 Part 2 — Introductions & Conflicts

Now we’ll all edit the same file to see how merge conflicts work visually.

1. Create another **branch** (example: `intro-lara`).  
2. Open the file `introductions.md`.  
3. Scroll to the bottom and fill out your intro under the line.
4. Save your file, commit your change, and **push** it.  
5. On **GitHub.com**, open a **Pull Request** to merge into **main**.  
6. If GitHub warns about a **merge conflict**, don’t panic!  
- Click **Resolve conflicts → Accept both changes → Mark as resolved → Commit merge**  
7. Merge it once everything looks good.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

✅ How to manage Git visually with **GitHub Desktop**  
✅ How to branch, commit, push, and merge without code  
✅ How to resolve merge conflicts using GitHub’s interface  
✅ How the GUI tools connect to the Git commands behind the scenes  

---

> 💡 **Remember:**  
> GitHub Desktop and GitHub.com are both interfaces built on top of Git — every button click still runs a Git command in the background.

✨ That’s it! You’ve just practiced the full Git workflow using **only visual tools** — the same way professionals use GitHub every day.
