# 👩‍💻 Git + GitHub (Command Line)

Welcome to the **Git + GitHub Lab!**  
Today you’ll learn how developers really use **Git and GitHub** — from the command line.  
You’ll create your own branch, make commits, push your changes, open pull requests, and even handle a merge conflict.  

---

## 🌱 Part 1 — Personal Branch

1. Create a new **branch** with your name (example: `branch-lara`)  
2. Inside the `people/` folder, make a **new file** named after you (example: `lara.md`)  
3. Write a short message inside like: "Hi, I'm Lara"
4. Save your file, **add**, **commit**, and **push** it to your branch  
5. On GitHub, **open a Pull Request** to merge your branch into **main**  
6. **Merge** it, then **delete your old branch** when finished

## 💬 Part 2 — Introductions & Conflicts

1. Create a **new branch** for this next task (example: `intro-lara`)  
2. Open the file called `introductions.md`  
3. Copy and fill out the format below **under the line**
4. **add**, **commit** and **push** your changes to your branch.
5. Create another **Pull Request** to merge your new branch into **main**  
6. If GitHub says there’s a **merge conflict**, fix it using **“Resolve conflicts” → “Accept both changes”**  
7. Merge it once everything looks good

> 💡 **Remember:**  
> A conflict doesn’t mean something went wrong — it means Git wants your opinion.  
> You decide which version stays.
